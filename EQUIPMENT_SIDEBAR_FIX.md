# Equipment Sidebar Update & Save Button Fix

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Equipment Selection Not Updating Sidebar ✅
**Problem**: When selecting equipment, the sidebar step completion status showed "Not started" instead of the equipment count.

**Root Cause**: The `selected_equipment` property was not configured as an entangled property between the client and server, so equipment changes made in JavaScript weren't syncing to the server-side component.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Added missing entangled property** in `resources/js/character-builder.js`:
   ```javascript
   selected_equipment: $wire.entangle('character.selected_equipment'),
   ```
2. **Simplified equipment selection logic** - removed redundant sync code since entangled properties handle this automatically
3. **Removed manual initialization code** that was trying to work around the missing entangled property

### Issue 1b: Apply Suggestions Button Not Updating Sidebar ✅
**Problem**: The "Apply All Suggestions" button would apply equipment but the sidebar wouldn't update until after saving.

**Root Cause**: When applying multiple equipment items at once, the entangled property sync needed an extra nudge to trigger the server-side sidebar update.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Added forced refresh** in `applySuggestedEquipment()` method using `$nextTick()` and `$wire.$refresh()`
2. **Removed redundant method calls** - let the template handle `markAsUnsaved()` to avoid timing conflicts

### Issue 2: Save Button Not Clearing After First Save ✅
**Problem**: The unsaved changes banner and save button didn't clear after the first save.

**Root Cause**: The JavaScript state capture was happening too slowly after the save, causing the `hasUnsavedChanges` state to remain true.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Reduced timing delay** in the JavaScript state capture from 300ms to 100ms since entangled properties sync faster
2. **Simplified save flow** by removing redundant event dispatching that was causing timing conflicts

## How to Test the Fixes

### Test 1a: Individual Equipment Selection
1. Go to Character Builder equipment step (step 6)
2. Note the sidebar shows "Equipment: Not started"
3. Select a primary weapon (e.g., click on the recommended weapon)
4. **Expected**: Sidebar should immediately show "Equipment: 1 items" or similar
5. Select armor
6. **Expected**: Sidebar should update to show "Equipment: 2 items" or similar
7. The sidebar should show the checkmark icon when equipment requirements are met

### Test 1b: Apply All Suggestions Button
1. Go to Character Builder equipment step (step 6)
2. Note the sidebar shows "Equipment: Not started"
3. Click the "Apply All Suggestions" button (green button at bottom)
4. **Expected**: The main area should immediately show "Complete!" with green checkmarks
5. **Expected**: The sidebar should immediately update to show equipment count (not "Not started")
6. **Expected**: Unsaved changes banner should appear

### Test 2: Save Button Clear Timing
1. Make any equipment selection to trigger unsaved state
2. Verify you see "You have unsaved changes" banner
3. Click the save button (floating save button or banner save button)
4. **Expected**: The unsaved changes banner should disappear immediately after one save
5. **Expected**: The save button should change from "Save Character" to "Saved" state immediately

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that:
- **Equipment selections sync automatically** between client and server via Livewire entangled properties
- **Sidebar updates immediately** when equipment is selected/deselected
- **Save state clears properly** on the first save without requiring a second save
- **No manual refresh calls needed** - everything works through automatic Livewire property synchronization

## Files Modified

1. `resources/js/character-builder.js` - Added entangled property and simplified equipment logic
2. `app/Livewire/CharacterBuilder.php` - Simplified save event dispatching
