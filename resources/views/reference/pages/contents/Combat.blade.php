<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Though Daggerheart relies on the same flow of collaborative storytelling in and out of combat, physical conflicts rely more heavily on several key mechanics related to attacking, maneuvering, and taking damage.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">EVASION</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Evasion</strong> represents a character’s ability to avoid attacks and other unwanted effects. Any roll made against a PC has a Difficulty equal to the target’s Evasion. A PC’s Base Evasion is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects.</p>

<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">HIT POINTS &amp; DAMAGE THRESHOLDS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Hit Points (HP)</strong> represent a character’s ability to withstand physical injury. When a character takes damage, they mark 1 to 3 HP, based on their <strong class="text-white font-semibold">damage thresholds</strong>:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">If the final damage is at or above the character’s Severe damage threshold, they mark 3 HP.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">If the final damage is at or above the character’s Major damage threshold but below their Severe damage threshold, they mark 2 HP.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">If the final damage is below the character’s Major damage threshold, they mark 1 HP.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If incoming damage is ever reduced to 0 or less, no HP is marked.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">A PC’s damage thresholds are calculated by adding their level to the listed damage thresholds of their equipped armor. A PC’s starting HP is based on their class, but they can gain additional Hit Points through advancements, features, and other effects.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">An adversary’s Damage Thresholds and HP are listed in their stat blocks.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When a character marks their last Hit Point, they fall. If a PC falls, they make a death move.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Characters can clear Hit Points by taking downtime moves (see: Downtime) or by activating relevant special abilities or effects.</p>

<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Optional Rule: Massive Damage</strong></em></p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">If a character ever takes damage equal to twice their Severe threshold, they mark 4 HP instead of 3.</em></p>
