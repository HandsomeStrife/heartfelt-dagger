<h1 class="font-outfit text-2xl font-bold text-white border-b border-slate-700 pb-3 mb-6 mt-0">STRESS</h1>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Stress</strong> represents how much mental, physical, and emotional strain a character can endure. Some special abilities or effects require the character activating them to mark Stress, and the GM can require a PC to mark Stress as a GM move or to represent the cost, complication, or consequence of an action roll.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When a character marks their last Stress, they become <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Vulnerable</strong> (see: Conditions) until they clear at least 1 Stress.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When a character must mark 1 or more Stress but can’t, they mark 1 HP instead. A character can’t use a move that requires them to mark Stress if all of their Stress is marked.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">PCs can clear Stress by making downtime moves (see: Downtime). A PC’s maximum Stress is determined by their class, but they can increase it through advancements, abilities, and other effects.</p>
