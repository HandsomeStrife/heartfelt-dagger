<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">ROLLING DICE</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The GM has no Duality Dice; instead, they roll a single d20 called the GM’s Die.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">ADVERSARY ATTACK ROLLS</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When an adversary attacks a PC, roll your d20 and add the adversary’s attack bonus to the result. If the total meets or beats the target’s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, the attack fails. On a successful attack, roll the attack’s damage dice to determine how much it deals.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If you roll a natural 20 on an attack, your roll automatically succeeds and you deal extra damage. Roll damage normally, then add the highest number on the damage dice to the total. For example, an attack that deals 3d6+2 deals 18+3d6+2 on a critical success; the critical success does not affect the flat damage modifier.</p>

<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">GUIDANCE ON ACTION ROLLS</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">After a player describes a move they want to make during the game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to determine how the scene progresses. Use this guide to determine what to present the player, choosing whichever option best fits the situation:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Determine whether the roll is necessary, considering the PC’s Experiences or backstory, the pressure they’re acting under, and the possible outcomes.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Establish the stakes of an action roll before the player makes it.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Communicate any unavoidable consequences.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">If desired, you can offer the player the opportunity to forgo an action roll in exchange for agreeing to an interesting outcome, cost, or complication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">MAKING MOVES</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">As the GM, you have <strong class="text-white font-semibold">GM moves</strong> that change the story in response to the players’ actions. GM moves aren’t bound by specific spells or effects—when you make a GM move, you can describe the action in whatever way the fiction demands.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">GM moves happen during <strong class="text-white font-semibold">GM turns</strong>. A GM turn begins when the spotlight passes to them and ends when the spotlight passes back to the players.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The GM can make a GM move whenever you want, but the frequency and severity depends on the type of story you’re telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the session you’re running.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Make a GM move when the players:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Roll with Fear</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Fail an action roll</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Do something that has unavoidable consequences</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Give you a “golden opportunity” (an opening that demands an immediate response)</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Look to you for what happens next</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">CHOOSING GM MOVES</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The result of a player’s action roll determines your response:</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">On a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Critical Success</strong>, you let the player describe their success, then give them an additional opportunity or advantage.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">On a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Success with Hope</strong>, you let the player describe their success, then you show how the world reacts to it.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">On a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Success with Fear</strong>, you work with the player to describe their success, then take a Fear and make a GM move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">An adversary attacks</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">The PC marks a Stress</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">You introduce a new threat</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">You raise the stakes of the conflict</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">On a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Failure with Hope</strong>, you describe how the PC fails to get what they want, then make a GM move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">An adversary attacks</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">The PC marks a Stress</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">You introduce a new threat</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">You raise the stakes of the conflict</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">On a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Failure with Fear</strong>, you describe how things go wrong, then make a GM move to introduce a major consequence, complication, or cost:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">You put them in immediate danger</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">They become the focus of multiple adversaries</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">They are separated from their party</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">They lose an important opportunity for good.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">QUICK REFERENCE: RESOLVING ACTION ROLLS</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">If you’re unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick phrases:</em></p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Success with Hope:</strong> Yes, and... (You get what you want and gain a Hope.)</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Success with Fear:</strong> Yes, but... (You get what you want, but there’s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Failure with Hope:</strong> No, but... (Things don’t go as planned, but you gain a Hope.)</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Failure with Fear:</strong> No, and... (Things don’t go as planned and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If the move you should make is not obvious from the fiction, draw inspiration from the “Example GM Moves” list:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Introduce a new obstacle or enemy</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Ask the player what happens</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Have the PC mark a Stress</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Tell the players “everything is fine... for now.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">SOFT AND HARD MOVES</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Soft moves</strong> go easier on the players—they give the party new information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to react to it. <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Hard moves</strong> are harsher, more impactful, or more direct—the PCs don’t get an opening to interrupt, alter, or anticipate the outcome.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Use softer moves on rolls with Hope and harder moves on rolls with Fear.</p>
<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10 py-2 px-4 rounded-r text-amber-100 mb-4">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Example GM Moves</strong></p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">• Show how the world reacts
• Ask a question and build on the answer
• Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive
• Drive a PC to take action by dangling their goals in front of them
• Signal an imminent off-screen threat
• Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger
• Force the group to split up
• Make a PC mark Stress
• Make a move the characters don’t see
• Show the collateral damage
• Clear an adversary’s condition
• Shift the environment
• Spotlight an adversary
• Capture someone or something important
• Use a PC’s backstory against them
• Take away an opportunity permanently.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">USING FEAR</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">You start a campaign with 1 Fear per PC in the party.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">You gain Fear whenever a PC rolls with Fear, the PCs take a rest (see: Downtime), or when an ability or effect tells you to.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">You can never have more than 12 Fear at one time.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Fear carries over between sessions.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Spend a Fear to:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Interrupt the players to steal the spotlight and make a move</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Make an additional GM move</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Use an adversary’s Fear Feature</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Use an environment’s Fear Feature</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Add an adversary’s Experience to a roll</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The dramatic tension of a scene correlates with the amount of Fear you spend during it. For guidance on how much Fear you should spend in a scene, consult the following table:</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">|                |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Incidental</strong> | A catch-up between PCs after an emotionally charged scene; gathering information; resupplying at a local market; resting during downtime.                                        | 0–1 Fear  |
| <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Minor</strong>      | A travel sequence; a minor skirmish that introduces new foes or signals future trouble.                                                                                          | 1–3 Fear  |
| <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Standard</strong>   | A substantial battle with a notable objective; perilous travel that tests might and wit; a tense social encounter seeking crucial information or aid.                            | 2–4 Fear  |
| <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Major</strong>      | A large battle with a Solo or Leader adversary; a character-defining scene with a significant change to a character’s personal story (such as revelation, growth, and betrayal). | 4–8 Fear  |
| <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Climactic</strong>  | A major confrontation with the villain of a story arc; an epic set piece battle; a judicial duel to determine an important NPC’s fate.                                           | 6–12 Fear |</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If you find yourself with a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">large amount of Fear</strong>, consider:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Spending Fast</strong>: Spend Fear before the players have a chance to react.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Spending Often</strong>: Spend Fear every time the spotlight swings to you.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Spending Big</strong>: Spend Fear to make multiple moves in a row.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Spending Fear to make a move communicates the increased impact of your action. Fear moves often include one or more of these elements:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Introducing new adversaries to a scene when their appearance hasn’t been foreshadowed or lacks context.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">An adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation to deal massive damage or boost their capabilities.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">An environment exerting a strong negative effect on the party.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">DIFFICULTY BENCHMARKS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Difficulty of an attack roll against an adversary is equal to the adversary’s Difficulty score. The Difficulty of any other action rolls against an adversary is equal to the adversary’s Difficulty score, plus (if applicable) the value of one of the adversary relevant Experience modifiers.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When a player makes an action roll without a specified Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty according to the totality of the circumstances. Refer to the following benchmark table for more guidance:</p>

<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">GIVING ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">To viscerally convey how a PC’s actions or circumstances affect their ability to act, grant them advantage or impose disadvantage instead of adjusting the Difficulty of an action roll.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">ADVERSARY ACTION ROLLS</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">By default, adversaries don’t normally make action rolls except for attack rolls and any unique actions described in their stat blocks. Any other action an adversary attempts simply succeeds without an action roll; if you want an adversary’s action to have a chance of failure, have any relevant PCs make reaction rolls instead.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">However, for especially dramatic or difficult tasks that the PCs can’t influence, you can give an adversary an <strong class="text-white font-semibold">action roll</strong> anyway. For an adversary’s action roll, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or greater than the action’s Difficulty, the action succeeds—otherwise it fails. You can spend a Fear before rolling to add a relevant Experience from the adversary’s stat block to the total. Use the same procedure when an adversary makes a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">reaction roll</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">ADVERSARY ADVANTAGE &amp; DISADVANTAGE</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If an adversary has advantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 and counts only the higher result. If an adversary has disadvantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 and counts only the lower result.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">ADVERSARY ATTACKS</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When an adversary attacks a PC, the GM rolls a d20 and adds the adversary’s Attack Modifier to the result. If the total meets or beats the target’s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Before rolling, the GM can grant the attacking adversary advantage, impose disadvantage, or spend a Fear to add a relevant Experience from the adversary’s stat block to the total.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">On a success, the adversary deals the damage listed in their stat block to the target.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When an adversary’s action lets the GM make an <strong class="text-white font-semibold">attack against multiple targets</strong>, they make one attack roll and compare it to each target’s Evasion separately.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">COUNTDOWNS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Countdowns</strong> represent a period of time or series of events preceding a future effect. A countdown begins at a starting value. When a countdown <strong class="text-white font-semibold">advances</strong>, it’s reduced by 1. The countdown’s effect is triggered when the countdown reaches 0.</p>
<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10 py-2 px-4 rounded-r text-amber-100 mb-4">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">Note: You can track countdowns by “spinning down” dice or ticking off boxes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Standard countdowns</strong> advance every time a player makes an action roll. If an adversary or environment ability refers to a “Countdown [n],” then it means a standard countdown with a starting value of n.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Dynamic countdowns</strong> advance by up to 3 depending on the outcomes of action rolls. <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Consequence countdowns</strong> are dynamic countdowns to negative effects. <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Progress countdowns</strong> are dynamic countdowns to positive effects. Dynamic countdowns advance according to this chart:</p>

<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">RUNNING GM NPCS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When you run NPCs as the GM, you should always strive to follow your GM principles and use them to bring the world to life. Differentiate NPCs with unique manners of speech and action; let their individual goals and desires motivate their actions.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The only essential elements for a NPC are their <strong class="text-white font-semibold">name</strong>, <strong class="text-white font-semibold">description</strong>, and <strong class="text-white font-semibold">motive</strong>. If it’s likely that the PCs will roll actions against them, give them a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Difficulty</strong>. Adversaries can be invented or improvised by modifying the stat block of another adversary.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If an NPC becomes an ally in combat, they don’t need a stat block—just put the spotlight on what they do and show how their involvement alters the fiction. If a PC capitalizes on their help during the scene, give the PC advantage. NPCs that don’t have Hit Points or Stress can still be injured or killed if the fiction demands it.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If you want an important NPC to mechanically interact with the system, you can give them one or more features with specific <strong class="text-white font-semibold">triggers</strong> and <strong class="text-white font-semibold">effects</strong>. An NPC might also have a choice that adjusts the parameters of their feature. For example:</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">NPC FEATURE EXAMPLES</h2>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">ARCANE HOLD</h3>

<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">FATE ROLLS</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When the GM wants to leave an outcome entirely up to chance, they call for a fate roll. The GM establishes what’s at stake and how the roll will be interpreted. Then a player rolls one of their Duality Dice and interprets the result.</p>
<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10 py-2 px-4 rounded-r text-amber-100 mb-4">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Examples:</strong></em></p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">FALLING AND COLLISION DAMAGE</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as a guide to determine the damage they take:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">A fall from Very Close range deals 1d10+3 physical damage.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical damage, or death at the GM’s discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If a character collides with an object or another character at a dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">MOVING AND FIGHTING UNDERWATER</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">By default, attack rolls made while the attacker is underwater have disadvantage.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">For creatures that can’t breathe underwater, use a standard countdown (3) to track how long they can hold their breath. Advance the countdown whenever the PC takes an action. In addition if they fail a roll or roll with Fear while underwater, you can spend your GM move to advance it an additional time—or twice, if they rolled a failure with Fear.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Once the countdown ends, the underwater PC must mark a Stress whenever they take an action.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">CONFLICT BETWEEN PLAYERS</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Sometimes a player might want their character to act against another PC in the scene. Before resorting to rolling dice, discuss the situation with both players to decide how to resolve the conflict. A roll might not be necessary to reach an outcome—but if rolling will be fun for everyone involved, come to a consensus on the terms of the roll, then facilitate the scene according to the results.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">On an attack roll against a PC, the attacker rolls against the defender’s Evasion, just like an adversary. On any other kind of action roll, the instigator makes an action roll and the target makes a reaction roll. To succeed, the instigator must beat a Difficulty equal to the total value of the reaction roll.</p>
