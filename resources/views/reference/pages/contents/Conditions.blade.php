<h1 class="font-outfit text-2xl font-bold text-white border-b border-slate-700 pb-3 mb-6 mt-0">CONDITIONS</h1>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Conditions</strong> are effects that grant specific benefits or drawbacks to the target they are attached to.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STANDARD CONDITIONS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Some features can apply special or unique conditions, which work as described in the feature text.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Unless otherwise noted, the same condition can’t be applied more than once to the same target.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Daggerheart has three standard conditions:</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">HIDDEN</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">While you’re out of sight from all enemies and they don’t otherwise know your location, you gain the Hidden condition. Any rolls against a Hidden creature have disadvantage. After an adversary moves to where they would see you, you move into their line of sight, or you make an attack, you are no longer Hidden.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">RESTRAINED</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Restrained characters can’t move, but you can still take actions from their current position.</p>
<h3 class="font-outfit text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-3">VULNERABLE</h3>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When a creature is Vulnerable, all rolls targeting them have advantage.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">TEMPORARY TAGS &amp; SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The <strong class="text-white font-semibold">temporary</strong> tag denotes a condition or effect that the affected creature can clear by making a move against it. When an affected PC makes a move to clear a temporary condition or effect, it normally requires a successful action roll using an appropriate trait. When an affected adversary makes a move to clear a temporary condition or effect, the GM puts the spotlight on the adversary and describes how they do it; this doesn’t require a roll but it does use up that adversary’s spotlight.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Special conditions</strong> are only cleared when specific requirements are met, such as completing a certain action or using a particular item. The requirements for clearing these conditions are stated in the text of the effect that applies the condition.</p>
