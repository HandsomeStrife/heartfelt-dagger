<h1 class="font-outfit text-2xl font-bold text-white border-b border-slate-700 pb-3 mb-6 mt-0">CHARACTER CREATION</h1>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Unless their table chooses to use pre-generated characters, each player creates their own PC by making a series of guided choices. Some of these decisions are purely narrative, meaning they only appear in or affect the game through roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the things their PC is able to do and which actions they’re more (or less) likely to succeed at when making moves and taking action.</p>

<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 1: CHOOSE A CLASS AND SUBCLASS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold"><a href="Classes.md" class="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">Classes</a></strong> are role-based archetypes that determine which class features and <strong class="text-white font-semibold">domain cards</strong> a PC gains access to throughout the campaign. There are nine classes in this SRD: Bard, Druid, Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, Wizard.</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Select a class and take its corresponding <strong class="text-white font-semibold">character sheet</strong> and <strong class="text-white font-semibold">character guide</strong> printouts. These sheets are for recording your PC’s details; you’ll update and reference them throughout the campaign.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Every class begins with one or more unique <strong class="text-white font-semibold">class feature(s)</strong>, described in the front of each class’s character sheet. If your class feature prompts you to make a selection, do so now.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Subclasses</strong> further refine a class archetype and reinforce its expression by granting access to unique <strong class="text-white font-semibold">subclass features</strong>. Each class comprises two subclasses. Select one of your class’s subclasses and take its <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Foundation</strong> card.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR HERITAGE</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Your character’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">heritage</strong> combines two elements: <strong class="text-white font-semibold"><a href="Ancestries.md" class="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">ancestry</a></strong> and <strong class="text-white font-semibold"><a href="Communities.md" class="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">community</a></strong>.</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">A character’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">ancestry</strong> reflects their lineage, impacting their physicality and granting them two unique <strong class="text-white font-semibold">ancestry features</strong>. Take the card for one of the following ancestries, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet: Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungirl, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simian. To create a Mixed Ancestry, take the top (first-listed) ancestry feature from one ancestry and the bottom (second-listed) ancestry feature from another.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Your character’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">community</strong> represents their culture or environment of origin and grants them a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">community feature</strong>. Take the card for one of the following communities, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet: Highborne, Loreborne, Orderborne, Ridgeborne, Seaborne, Skyborne, Underborne, Wanderborne, Wildborne.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 3: ASSIGN CHARACTER TRAITS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Your character has six traits that represent their physical, mental, and social aptitude:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Agility</strong> (Use it to Sprint, Leap, Maneuver, etc.)<br />
A high Agility means you’re fast on your feet, nimble on difficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. You’ll make an Agility Roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or bound from rooftop to rooftop.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Strength</strong> (Use it to Lift, Smash, Grapple, etc.)<br />
A high Strength means you’re better at feats that test your physical prowess and stamina. You’ll make a Strength Roll to break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your ground against a charging foe.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Finesse</strong> (Use it to Control, Hide, Tinker, etc.)<br />
A high Finesse means you’re skilled at tasks that require accuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. You’ll make a Finesse Roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with precision.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Instinct</strong> (Use it to Perceive, Sense, Navigate, etc.)<br />
A high Instinct means you have a keen sense of your surroundings and a natural intuition. You’ll make an Instinct Roll to sense danger, notice details in the world around you, or track an elusive foe.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Presence</strong> (Use it to Charm, Perform, Deceive, etc.)<br />
A high Presence means you have a strong force of personality and a facility for social situations. You’ll make a Presence Roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or capture the attention of a crowd.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Knowledge</strong> (Use it to Recall, Analyze, Comprehend, etc.)<br />
A high Knowledge means you know information others don’t and understand how to apply your mind through deduction and inference. You’ll make a Knowledge Roll to interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember important information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When you “roll with a trait,” that trait’s modifier is added to the roll’s total. Assign the modifiers +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1 to your character’s traits in any order you wish.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 4: RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARACTER INFORMATION</h2>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Characters start a new campaign at <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Level 1</strong>. Record your level in the designated space at the top of your character sheet.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Evasion</strong> represents your character’s ability to avoid damage. Your character’s starting Evasion is determined by their class and appears directly beneath the Evasion field on your character sheet; copy this number into the Evasion field.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Hit Points (HP)</strong> are an abstract measure of your physical health. Your starting HP is determined by your class and is recorded on your character sheet.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Stress</strong> reflects your ability to withstand the mental and emotional strain of dangerous situations and physical exertion. Every PC starts with 6 Stress slots.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Hope</strong> is a metacurrency that fuels special moves and certain abilities or features. All PCs start with 2 Hope; mark these in the Hope field of your character sheet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 5: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Choose your <strong class="text-white font-semibold"><a href="Weapons.md" class="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">weapon(s)</a></strong>:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Select from the Tier 1 Weapon Tables. Either a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">two-handed primary weapon</strong> or a <strong class="text-white font-semibold">one-handed primary weapon and a one-handed secondary weapon</strong>. Then equip your selection by recording it in the Active Weapon field of your character sheet.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">At Level 1, your <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Proficiency</strong> is 1; write this number in the Proficiency field on your character sheet, then calculate and record your <strong class="text-white font-semibold">damage roll</strong> by combining your Proficiency value with your equipped weapon(s) <strong class="text-white font-semibold">damage dice.</strong> <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">Example: If your Proficiency is 1 and your weapon’s damage dice is d6+1, your damage roll is 1d6+1. Proficiency only determines how many damage dice you roll, and does not affect any flat damage modifiers.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Choose and equip one set of <strong class="text-white font-semibold"><a href="Armor.md" class="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">armor</a></strong> from the Tier 1 Armor Table, then record its details in the <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Active Armor</strong> field of your character sheet.</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Add your character’s level to your equipped armor’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Base Score</strong> and record the total for both numbers in the corresponding fields. At character creation, your level is 1.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Record your <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Armor Score</strong> in the field at the top left of your character sheet. Your Armor Score is equal to your equipped armor’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Base Score</strong> plus any permanent bonuses your character has to their Armor Score from other abilities, features, or effects.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Add the following items to the <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Inventory</strong> fields on your character sheet:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">A torch, 50 feet of rope, basic supplies, and a handful of gold (mark one box in the left-hand column of your character sheet titled “Gold &gt; Handfuls”)</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">EITHER a Minor Health Potion (clear 1d4 Hit Points) OR a Minor Stamina Potion (clear 1d4 Stress)</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">One of the class-specific items listed on your character guide</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">If applicable, whichever class-specific item you selected to carry your spells</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Any other GM-approved items you’d like to have at the start of the game</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 6: CREATE YOUR BACKGROUND</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Develop your character’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">background</strong> by answering the <strong class="text-white font-semibold">background questions</strong> in your character guide, modifying or replacing them if they don’t fit the character you want to play.</p>
<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10 py-2 px-4 rounded-r text-amber-100 mb-4">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Note:</strong></em> <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">Your background has no explicit mechanical effect, but it greatly affects the character you’ll play and the prep the GM will do. Throughout character creation, you can adjust choices you made in earlier steps to better reflect this background as your character takes shape. If you wish, you can leave your character’s past more ambiguous for the time being and discover their backstory through play.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 7: CREATE YOUR EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">An Experience is a word or phrase used to encapsulate a specific set of skills, personality traits, or aptitudes your character has acquired over the course of their life. When your PC makes a move, they can spend a Hope to add a relevant Experience’s modifier to an action or reaction roll.</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Your PC gets two Experiences at character creation, each with a +2 modifier.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">There’s no set list of Experiences to choose from, but an Experience can’t be too broadly applicable and it can’t grant your character specific mechanical benefits, such as magic spells or special abilities. <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">For example, “Lucky” and “Highly Skilled” are too broad because they could apply to virtually any roll. Likewise, “Supersonic Flight” and “Invulnerable” imply game-breaking special abilities.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10 py-2 px-4 rounded-r text-amber-100 mb-4">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">EXAMPLE EXPERIENCES</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 8: CHOOSE DOMAIN CARDS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Your class has access to two of the nine <a href="Domains.md" class="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">Domains</a> included in the core set. Choose two cards from your class’s domains, which are listed in the upper left of your character sheet. You can take one card from each domain or two from a single domain, whichever you prefer.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STEP 9: CREATE YOUR CONNECTIONS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Connections are the relationships between the PCs. To create connections, follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Go around the table and have each player describe their characters to one another—at a minimum, their name, pronouns, character description, experiences, and the answers to their background questions.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Discuss potential connections between the PCs using the questions included in the “Connections” section of your character guide as inspiration.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Suggest at least one connection between your character and each other player’s PC. Accept any suggested connections you want to explore, reject any you don’t.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10 py-2 px-4 rounded-r text-amber-100 mb-4">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Note:</strong></em> <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">A player can reject a suggested connection for any reason, and it’s okay if there isn’t an established connection between every pair of PCs—you can always discover and develop those relationships through play.</em></p>
</blockquote>
