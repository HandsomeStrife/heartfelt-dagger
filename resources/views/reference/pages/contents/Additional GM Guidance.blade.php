<h1 class="font-outfit text-2xl font-bold text-white border-b border-slate-700 pb-3 mb-6 mt-0">ADDITIONAL GM GUIDANCE</h1>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">This section provides additional guidance for preparing and running a session of Daggerheart.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">STORY BEATS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">In storytelling, a beat is a moment that changes the trajectory of the narrative—a shift in the world, a significant action or reaction, an emotional revelation, or an important decision. Take turns with the players, narrating a beat and then letting them react and carry the scene forward with their own beats. When preparing for a session, plan in terms of the moments that give shape to each scene or sequence, rather than pre-scripting specific details or exchanges.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">PREPARING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Build the hurdles the PCs face around the question of “What helps tell the story?” Enemies, environments, and hazards are the tools for heightening tension and creating drama. Ensure that combat is being used to give players more information about the unfolding story, revealing the world, the plot, or the characters.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">BATTLES AND NARRATIVE</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Dynamic battles create suspense by forcing players to choose between their various objectives, engaging their character’s motivations and weaknesses, and creating the crucible that the players use to forge their characters into legendary heroes. When preparing combat encounters:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Consider the narrative function of the battle</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Base adversaries’ moves on their motives</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Use dynamic environments to bring the battleground to life</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Add enemies that can interact with the PCs’ features and special abilities</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">SESSION REWARDS</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Reward players at the end of a session with:</p>

<li class="leading-relaxed">Story hooks</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Loot</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Gold</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Access to new equipment or enhancements</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">CRAFTING SCENES</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Whenever you start a session, arrive at a new place, or change the situation, tell the players what they need to know by thinking with all of your senses and sharing something unique or unexpected about the fiction.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">ENGAGING YOUR PLAYERS</h2>

<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">PHASED BATTLES</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Make battles by shifting the nature of its enemies or environment mid-combat:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">Change the Terms of Engagement</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Alter the Environment</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">Evolve the Opposition</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">USING DOWNTIME</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Use downtime scenes as a pressure release valve to vary the intensity of the story and give the PCs room to breathe.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Empower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">PROJECTS DURING DOWNTIME</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Work on a Project downtime move requires more GM input than other downtime moves and is best suited for long-term endeavors the PCs wish to undertake.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">These projects are typically tracked using a Progress Countdown. When deciding the starting value of the countdown, consider the complexity of the project, the availability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project on the story.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Simple projects advance their countdown each time a player uses the Work on a Project move, but complex projects require a roll.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">EXTENDED DOWNTIME</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When you fast-forward the story across an extended period, use montages to illustrate the passage of time. You gain 1d6 Fear per PC and advance any long-term countdowns as appropriate.</p>
