<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">You can play Daggerheart using “theater of the mind” or maps and miniatures. The conversions below from abstract ranges to physical measurements assume 1 inch of map represents about 5 feet of fictional space.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Daggerheart uses the following <strong class="text-white font-semibold">ranges</strong> to translate fictional positioning into relative distance for the purposes of targeting, movement, and other game mechanics:</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Melee:</strong> Close enough to touch, up to a few feet away.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Very Close:</strong> Close enough to see fine details, about 5–10 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Very Close range into Melee range. <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">On a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card (2-3 inches).</em></li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Close:</strong> Close enough to see prominent details, about 10–30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Close range into Melee range. <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">On a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5-6 inches).</em></li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Far:</strong> Close enough to see very little detail, about 30–100 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Far range into Melee range. <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">On a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a piece of copy paper (11–12 inches).</em></li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Very Far:</strong> Too far to make out any details, about 100–300 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Very Far range into Melee range. <em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">On a map: anything beyond Far range, but still within the bounds of the conflict or scene.</em></li>
<li class="leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Out of Range:</strong> Anything beyond a character’s Very Far range is Out of Range and usually can’t be targeted.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Range is measured from the source of an effect, such as the attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">A weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effect’s stated range is a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at closer distances.</p>

<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Optional Rule: Defined Ranges</strong></em></p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">If your table would rather operate with more precise range rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat. If you do, use the following guidelines for play:</em></p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">- <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Melee:</strong> 1 square</em>
<em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">- <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Very Close:</strong> 3 squares</em>
<em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">- <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Close:</strong> 6 squares</em>
<em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">- <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Far:</strong> 12 squares</em>
<em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">- <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Very Far:</strong> 13+ squares</em>
<em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">- <strong class="text-white font-semibold">Out of Range:</strong> Off the battlemap</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">MOVEMENT UNDER PRESSURE</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When you’re under pressure or in danger and make an action roll, you can move to a location within Close range as part of that action. If you’re not already making an action roll, or if you want to move farther than your Close range, you need to succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">An adversary can move within Close range for free as part of an action, or within Very Far range as a separate action.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">AREA OF EFFECT</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Unless stated otherwise, all the targets of a group effect must be within Very Close range of a single origin point within your effect’s range.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">LINE OF SIGHT &amp; COVER</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Unless stated otherwise, a ranged attacker must have <strong class="text-white font-semibold">line of sight</strong> to their intended target to make an attack roll. If a partial obstruction lies between the attacker and target, the target has <strong class="text-white font-semibold">cover</strong>. Attacks made through cover are rolled with disadvantage. If the obstruction is total, there is no line of sight.</p>
