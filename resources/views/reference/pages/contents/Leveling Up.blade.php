<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Your party levels up whenever the GM decides you’ve reached a narrative milestone (usually about every 3 sessions). All party members level up at the same time.</p>

If your loadout is already full, you can’t add the new card to it until you move another into your vault. You can also exchange one domain card you’ve previously acquired for a different domain card of the same level or lower.</p>
