<h1 class="font-outfit text-2xl font-bold text-white border-b border-slate-700 pb-3 mb-6 mt-0">ARMOR</h1>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Every armor has a name, base damage thresholds, and a base Armor Score. Some armor also has a feature.</p>
<ul class="text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">An armor’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">base armor score</strong> indicates how many Armor Slots it provides its wearer before additional bonuses are added to calculate their total Armor Score. A PC’s Armor Score can’t exceed 12.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">An armor’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">base thresholds</strong> determine its wearer’s major and severe damage thresholds before adding bonuses to calculate their final damage thresholds.</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">An armor’s <strong class="text-white font-semibold">feature</strong> is a special rule that stays in effect while the armor is equipped.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">While <strong class="text-white font-semibold">unarmored</strong>, your character’s base Armor Score is 0, their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe threshold is equal to twice their level.</p>
<h2 class="font-outfit text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mt-8 mb-4">REDUCING INCOMING DAMAGE</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">When you take damage, you can mark one Armor Slot to reduce the number of Hit Points you would mark by one. If your character has an Armor Score of 0, you can’t mark Armor Slots. If an effect temporarily increases your Armor Score, it increases your available Armor Slots by the same amount; when the effect ends, so does the availability of these Armor Slots.</p>
