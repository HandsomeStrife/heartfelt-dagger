<h1 class="font-outfit text-2xl font-bold text-white border-b border-slate-700 pb-3 mb-6 mt-0">GOLD</h1>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Gold is an abstract measurement of how much wealth a character has, and is measured in <strong class="text-white font-semibold">handfuls, bags, and chests,</strong> with 10 handfuls to 1 bag, and 10 bags to 1 chest. When you have marked all of the slots in a category and you gain another gold reward in that category, mark a slot in the following category and clear all the slots in the current one.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">For example, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you instead mark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags and gain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">You can’t have more than 1 chest, so if all your Gold slots are marked, you’ll need to spend some of your gold or store it somewhere else before you can acquire more.</p>
