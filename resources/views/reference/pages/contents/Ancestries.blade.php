<h1 class="font-outfit text-2xl font-bold text-white border-b border-slate-700 pb-3 mb-6 mt-0">ANCESTRIES</h1>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Ancestries</strong> represent your character’s lineage, which affects their physical appearance and access to certain special abilities. The following section describes each ancestry in Daggerheart and the characteristics generally shared by members of that ancestry. However, each player decides how their character aligns with the “standard” or “average” expression of their ancestry.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">In Daggerheart, the term “people” is used to refer to all ancestries, as individuals from all lineages possess unique characteristics and cultures, as well as personhood.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Some ancestries are described using the term <strong class="text-white font-semibold">“humanoid.”</strong> This does not imply any genetic relation to “humans,” which is a distinct ancestry within Daggerheart. Instead, it refers to the set of physical characteristics humans will recognize from their own anatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright posture, facial layout, and more. These traits vary by ancestry and individual, though “humanoid” should still provide a useful frame of reference.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The core ruleset includes the following ancestries: Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungirl, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simian, and Mixed Ancestry.</p>
<h4 class="font-outfit text-base font-bold text-amber-200 mt-4 mb-2">ANCESTRY FEATURES</h4>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Each ancestry grants two <strong class="text-white font-semibold">ancestry features.</strong> While some features specify the anatomy of any player character of that ancestry’s anatomy, players determine their characters’ physical form. Work with the GM to re-flavor any implied traits that don’t align with your character concept.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If you’d like to make a character who combines more than one ancestry, see “Mixed Ancestry.”</p>

<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Families within the world of Daggerheart are as unique as the peoples and cultures that inhabit it. Anyone’s appearance and abilities can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety of other factors.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple ancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the game, use the steps below:</p>
<ol class="text-slate-300 list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
<li class="leading-relaxed">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Determine Ancestry Combination</strong>
When you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down how your character identifies themself in the Heritage section of your character sheet. For example, if your character is descended from both goblins and orcs, you could use a hybridized term, such as “goblin-orc.” To describe your ancestry, list only the ancestry you more closely identify with (e.g., just “goblin” or just “orc”), or invent a new term, such as “toothling.”</p>
</li>
<li class="leading-relaxed">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong class="text-white font-semibold">Choose Ancestry Features</strong>
Work with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries in your character’s lineage. You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10 py-2 px-4 rounded-r text-amber-100 mb-4">
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em class="text-amber-300 not-italic">For example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the “Surefooted” and “Tusks” features or the “Sturdy” and “Danger Sense” features. You can’t take both the “Surefooted” and “Sturdy” features because both are the first features listed on their respective ancestry cards.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Your character’s heritage might include more than two ancestries, but you still only choose features from two. You can represent additional ancestries through their appearance or backstory.</p>
