# HeartfeltDagger

A DaggerHeart TTRPG companion website that allows for character creation and more features coming in the future.

## Tech Stack

- **Laravel 12** - PHP framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Styling
- **Livewire** - Dynamic frontend components
- **AlpineJS** - Client-side JavaScript interactions
- **Spatie Laravel Data** - DTOs and data objects

## Development Setup

This project uses Laravel Sail for local development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate application key
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate

# Start the development environment
./vendor/bin/sail up -d

# Run migrations
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate

# Build assets
npm run dev

# Playwright browsers are automatically set up on first container start
```

## Browser Testing Setup

sail root-shell
  npx playwright install-deps
sail npx playwright install

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

### Architecture & Code Standards

- **Domain-Driven Design**: All business logic goes in `domain/` folder, never in `app/Domain`
- **PSR-12 Compliance**: Strict adherence to PSR-12 coding standards
- **snake_case** for variables, **camelCase** for functions/methods
- **No `@php` directives** in Blade templates

### Code Organization

- **Models**: Located in `domain/*/Models` (never in `app` namespace)
- **Actions**: Business logic in `domain/*/Actions` with single `execute()` method
- **Repositories**: Data retrieval only, returning DTOs (no data modification)
- **Data Objects**: DTOs in `domain/*/Data` using Spatie Laravel Data
- **Livewire Components**: In `app/Livewire/` for UI components

### Development Patterns

- Use `./vendor/bin/sail` for all Artisan commands
- Actions executed as: `(new Action())->execute(...)`
- Create DTOs with `DataClass::from(...)`
- Use Laravel collections, not data collections
- Prefer client-side JavaScript (AlpineJS) for simple interactions

### Testing Requirements

- **All new code must include tests**
- Use `#[Test]` attributes (not `@test`)
- **No mocks** except for external APIs
- Use **Playwright via Pest** for browser testing
- Use factories for test data setup
- No skipped tests allowed
- Run tests with `./vendor/bin/sail pest`

### Before Contributing

1. **Check existing code** before creating new files/classes
2. **Search the codebase** for similar functionality
3. **Ask for clarification** if unsure about implementation
4. **Follow existing patterns** and naming conventions

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure all tests pass
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Include tests for new functionality
- Keep commits focused and well-described
- Reference any related issues
